It refers to how we will not be compensated/taken care of when we fall sick/get injured because of the living expenses etc. Regarding the queuing system, it is due to the country being so small & overpopulated, resulting in most restaurant's and places being space-constrained.

I found them a little robotic at times, though in some ways I think I admired what came across as the constant discipline. On the plus side of this, yes it is fantastically safe. We had an amah, but the way I looked at it was she needed the employment, she could have had it worse and she knew it. It beats not appreciating that and well, turfing them out to do whatever. I've watched a lot of your videos now, was very taken aback how mosquitos seemed to like you when you first got there, maybe still do? I never had a big issue with them there. For culture I'd cover religion there, best to take a local with you who understands what's going on and can guide you on the etiquette, but the Temples on Sin Ming drive, Ang Mo Kio are well worth covering I think, though they are very much working temples, funerals, offerings to God's, the lot is going on there but worth visiting whilst you're there I think.

If u r single, u can only purchase it when u hit 35. Unless, that singaporean is rich, he/she can move out and purchase a house early provided that it is a private housing or a resale HDB. In a nutshell, the average singaporean still lives with their parents because housing in singapore is crazy expensive from 3 room HDB ranging at $250,000-$350,000.

9 Bizarre Things Singaporeans Do That Foreigners Don’t Understand!,Kuma-kun,3 months ago (edited),"About ice cream in bread: there’s also a wafer option (in place of bread)—but preferences aside, I’ve theorised that the bread option may have came about for a few practical reasons; (1) bread can absorb melted ice cream (and ice cream melts really quickly here), thus minimising unintentional stains or spills on yourself/your clothes/the floor, etc. (2) an open packet of bread retains the texture and mouth-feel of bread longer than an open tin of wafers preserves its crunchy texture—partly because there are less slices of bread in a packet than there are pieces of wafer in a tin, so they tend to be used up quicker. And (3) because the bread tends to be folded over the block of ice cream like a taco shell, it kind of protects your hand from both the cold of the ice cream and it’s drippings.",8,,GC

10 ‘Unusual’ Old English Words Commonly Used In Singapore!,stillwatersrundeep,4 months ago,"8:08 - representing Singaporeans (at least those who know better), i can confirm that ""stuffs"" and its kind are not legitimate words, nor an accepted alternative grammar rule. It's not a translation thing either. Some people never learned or have forgotten the distinction between countable and uncountable nouns, so default to the general rule of adding ""s"" to make plurals. That probably accounts for 50% of the times you've heard it; the other 50% are by people who do know better but do it in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek way.",1,View reply,GC

‘WEIRD’ THINGS SINGAPOREANS DO THAT BRITS DON’T UNDERSTAND,vMonsieur R,2 years ago,"Hello, I think I can say I am a typical Singaporean. And these are based on my exp. And pardon for my singlish
1) the extension 'one'. The only logical explanation i can give u as a singaporen is that we use 'one' to replace 'is'. Eg, 'she just gossiped about you' 'really ah? Why she like that one ah?' or 'why she so mean one ah?' or 'why like that one ah?' when its suppose to be 'why is she like that?' etc. For the 'can one' in proper english is 'i can guarantee you i can do it'",10,,GC
‘WEIRD’ THINGS SINGAPOREANS DO THAT BRITS DON’T UNDERSTAND,Mohd Anis,2 years ago,"I work part-time at a restaurant and I never really know any of my colleagues asking if the customer wouldn't mind seating with a stranger. As far as I know, if there is not really any seats available, we will respectfully ask the customer to wait awhile so that we can arrange a seat for them as fast as possible. while asking them to take a look at the menu to decide on their meals to quicken up the pace of which we could get their orders through to the kitchen. Honestly, I can only say how my outlet operates. I cannot say for all. I am working part-time at Swensens Plaza Singapura by the way. Therefore, if any of you ever been there, you would know what I mean. For the sharing of cutleries as many had mentioned, we Singaporeans always ask first nicely if the other party is silva conscious or not before sharing.",0,View reply from Georgia Caney,GC

One dislike I have with Singapore is so crowded!, especially at shopping malls & in the MRT, it seems every time I visit Singapore it gets more crowded. Also the amount of plastic bags in Supermarkets, even when your only getting one or two items they put it in a plastic bag for you, where I live in Australia, there are no plastic bags anywhere anymore.

What Driving In Singapore Is REALLY Like! 🇸🇬 Expat Living,AGUS LEE,11 months ago (edited),"Well in Singapore, our cars is very expensive and only have a 10 year lease is because the government needs to control the number of cars on the road. If they don’t do that, Singapore will be like its neighbouring countries cities for  example Bangkok, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur whereby traffic jams is like a norm which last for hrssssss and getting a cup of coffee and some groceries which is like only 3 blocks away will take you eternity to reach. Like what Justin says Singapore is a city state and like any other cities....you don’t need a car to travel as public transport is super accessible and very cheap too compared to other countries.Having a car in Singapore is not a necessity but more of a commodity.",19,DOWNLOAD,GC

PROS & CONS OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬,TheInfinityDelta,3 years ago,"Well, I guess the tradeoff for having low taxes is the lack of an NHS. In fact, the government had discussed about this in the past and the prime minister then (LKY), he did not want the citizens to become reliant on government help as it would potentially breed laziness, complacency, and taking things for granted. Sort of like (oh, I don't have to take care of my own body and if I am sick, healthcare is free). This would have a bad economic impact on the country then, which was still developing, where if everyone falls sick/abuse the NHS system then productivity of companies would fall and so would revenue. The good part is that there are lots of social services around. An example would be the number of homeless citizens here. There are definitely homeless people here but it is very rare to find them due to the amount of social service we have here. Anyway, these social services or even the government would help, if they could, for those who really cannot afford healthcare. The subsidies provided by the government depends on the level of income as well (low income earners gets 80% subsidies on hospital wards and general bills). I guess this reduces the number of people who plans to live off others (the govt lol).",43,View 18 replies from Georgia Caney and others,GC

She bought the house gambling that the price will increase, but she doesn't have enough cash on her hand so she can't afford to let it sit there and do nothing. So they rent their house out, but once you have people living in the house the value will drop because of the renovations required as compared to ""brand new"" houses within the same vicinity. They will always demand their tenants to abide by ridiculous rules, avoid those landlords all in all.

N yes, standing on the left of the escalator is supposed to be the correct side. It just makes more sense. In the UK and Singapore we all keep to the left side of the road when driving cars. Why shouldn't it be the same for escalators? If the left side is used for driving n the right is for escalator, people who are tired can get confused on the roads.

I mean, if your ear isn't that sensitive and heals relatively well, I would recommend you just get it done at any place that uses the guns. Those at Far East uses the needles and requires skills thats why it costs a whole lot more. The one in cine is like $3-4 per piercing and I haven't had any problems with mine!

SINGAPORE FURNISHED APARTMENT TOUR | SINGAPORE EXPATS,Crosby Ong,1 year ago,Hi Georgia! Thanks for all the helpful tips. I have recently moved to Singapore from Tokyo and would like to ask how orders get delivered here. In Japan we can select the exact date and time (in 2-hour time slots) when we expect to be home to receive the delivery. I would usually select the latest time slot (until 9pm) as I’m out all day on weekdays. How does it work in Singapore if the delivery arrives when you are not home? My colleague told me I would have to pick it up at the closest post office but that wouldn’t be practical for bulky items. Thanks!,0,,GC

THINGS YOU SHOULDN’T DO IN SINGAPORE!🇸🇬,Jayaprakash Jayabal,2 years ago,"I think like others have said, these laws are rarely enforced.

I feel like the law on nudity at home is there for cases whereby individuals deliberately expose themselves, or when there is an inconsiderate individual who chooses to be in front of a window naked despite maybe there being kids? Honestly some of these laws do sound a little ridiculous to me as a local but I do believe policemen or officers do use their discretion to judge a situation and not just blindly follow the book. The laws that really get on my nerves are the laws against suicide and homosexuality- which are rarely enforced too, but the fact that they still exist say something about our culture, and these laws feel like a violation of rights tbh.

Because of the nature of the rule, it is extremely hard to be prosecuted for this due to the fact that it is extremely hard to catch and arrest anyone that is having gay sex. There have been one or two people charged with it, but i don’t think there have been anyone that has actually been found guilty for this. The rule is actually quite loose, and used as a deterrent for any sort of male homosexual behaviour. Because people rarely actively seek out the terms and conditions of this law, they tend to stray away from any sort of homosexual behaviour due to fear of being arrested and charged.",2,View reply,GC

EXPAT LIVING IN SINGAPORE | UPDATE,darrendelong,4 years ago,"Singlish is basically a mix of broken English and local dialects such as Malay, Tamil and Chinese dialects (usually not Mandarin). 

Well, Lah is NOT exactly used at the end of all sentences. It really depends. It's can be used when you want to put an emphasis to your statement. Lah is not used when you are asking a question. For example, if you wanna say ""I am going!"", you can say ""I am going lah"".  2nd eg. ""Oh, come on!"", you can say ""Come on lah"", ""Oh please, don't do it"" becomes ""Please lah, don't do it leh"". Leh in this context becomes like a request.

I live in Singapore and Singlish is a really difficult to understand by foreigners 😂 it's kind of our language it's difficult to explain what it means but I'm pretty sure you'll get used to it 👌🏻 also I think you find the air con unbearable because in Singapore its burning so Malls tend to turn down the air con because it's so hot and we're used to it :) Singapore has a lot of sightseeing places and small streets which are amazing. I suggest haji lane if you have like a photo taking day because it's so photo worthy 👌🏻 there's cafes there too and usually on weekend nights they have a little flea with a lot of food and performances. I personally have never been there at night but I've been there for photoshoots and it's pretty cool ☺️ cafe hopping is pretty popular and one of the cafes you should try is the cat cafe at Victoria street.

Foreigners First Time In Geylang! 🇸🇬,Meifern Lee,1 year ago (edited),"The word Geylang is found early in Singapore's history and also in early topographical maps showing marsh and coconut plantations beside and adjacent to the mouth of the Kallang River, home to the Orang Laut (sea gypsies). One possible etymological link in the stock vocabulary of the Malay is 'geylanggan' meaning to 'twist' or 'crush' a reference to the process of extracting the coconut meat and milk used by the locals to thicken curries in Malay-Chinese (Peranakan) cuisine. The idea persists to this day, of the process of heartache and desperation associated with the broken and hurting lives of those involved in buying and selling of sex and drugs on the streets and in the registered brothel in the area. The word Geylang may be derived from a corrupted spelling of the Malay word 'gelang' which is a type of edible creeper (Portulaca oleracea). This is a more plausible explanation for the name because Malays typically name places based on the abundance of certain plant species (e.g. Melaka after the tree species of the same name) or geological formations (e.g. Bukit Gombak based on the comb-like hill summit.",14,View reply,GC

The Truth About Why It's So Hard For Foreigners To Leave Singapore,David Ng,1 day ago,"I am bias for cooler weather because I associate it with vacations but my longest time away in cooler weather was just 6 weeks in Europe late summer/early fall and for 3 weeks during winters. I think what makes the European weather amazing is that you can sit on the grass outside and get some sun in summer without sweating. It encourages people to get out and be around nature and be active. In winter, the SAD from a lack of Vit D and isolation can be combated by meeting friends over a hot chocolate drink. It incentivizes meeting people and entering a restaurant, pub or even home is like a big warm hug that envelopes you. I think tropical people also have reason to romanticize seasonal weather because like changing curtains or rearranging furniture, the weather changes seasonally to keep things fresh. By the time you get bored of the current weather, a new season arrives and with it comes its foods, activities and colours that force you to adapt to it.",2,,GC

Seriously, you'll go cray with the shopping. Once you familiarize urself with the place, you'll know where to get the best stuff! I recommend 313 somerset, bugis junction, and pretty much the whole of orchard road (little hard to figure out, but once u do, you'll return every day haha). Everyone's very helpful and it's a very safe country. I would say to do all the touristy things and make the most out of ur time there! The nightlife is also pretty good.

First of all congrats on your new apt. It's lovely and it looks very cozy! I've been watching a few of your videos since my boyfriend and I started to wander around the idea of moving to Singapore. We've been there a couple of times traveling and for business purposes and we honestly love this place and many things and in there. So I was wondering if you have any tips in finding the places. I mean, is there a specific webpage, app or company you'd recommend, like how did you find your own apts. And how is it to rent as a foreigner? Do they request a lot of documents and how for how long usually the contracts are?",2,,GC

Interesting fact of Kampong glam: (from culture trip website) 
The history of Kampong Glam can be traced back to the 1820s when it was first named. The name comes from the Malay language where kampung means ‘village’ and ‘gelam’ was a type of tree known as the Paperbark tree that grew in the area and was frequently used for building ships. For a long time, Kampong Glam was a fishing village due to its location on the Rochor River. In 1820s, Sir Stamford Raffles designated the Kampong Glam as well as an annual stipend to Sultan Hussain Mohammed Shah for use by the Muslim community after he signed a treaty ceding Singapore to the East India Company.",10,,GC

I believe it is because when we say fruit, we usually think of something sweet, cold, and juicy. Hence when most westerners try durians, the warm, bitter taste of it puts them off. ",63,View reply,GC

Air-con company advise us to set the air-con to medium fan speed and it fixed the problem. Another thing possible reason is the coil in the air-con could be stuffed with dirt so it's time for chemical cleaning. Normally air-cons need chemical cleaning once a year, and general servicing every 3 months.

10 Singlish Words And Phrases That Left Me CONFUSED,Javier,5 months ago (edited),"I think a lot of people have chimed in on the meanings, so I will contribute a little bit on the pronunciation.

Let me give you an example based on one of the phrases you featured - 'kan/gan cheong spider'. (The reason why we still use either 'K' or 'G' to spell it, is because that's the only alphabet we learned when we were in school, but it's not actually an accurate representation of the sound being produced.)",98,View reply,GC

BEING A TOURIST IN SINGAPORE IS EXPENSIVE! 💵 WEEKLY VLOG,eLtitude,1 year ago (edited),"here's what I've learned to do to get rid of stitches as you get them on the fly. apply immense pressure on the area of pain, likely under the diaphragm and with ONE huge deep puff, breathe out, should almost sound like you're saying HEEEEWWWWWWW when you deep breathe out. takes away 60-70% of the stitch almost immediately. rest of it either bleeds out or (less likely, but it happens) starts to build up agn and at tht point, simply rinse and repeat. practice 3-5 times and you'll be able to get the technique and desired effect down. eventually, you'll learn to perform it while running. a stitch is an acute pain caused by an air bubble building up over time under the diaphragm and gets trapped, it takes a while to get rid of naturally by waiting it out or without physical ""intervention"" , so to avoid it, breath control is key. its important then to be conscious when breathing in, essentially do less of it. for me, I breathe in as I would normally on a run, maybe a touch less even, but I then take double short to medium breaths out, generally helps exhale more air out than I normally do, we're trying as much as possible to match the air outtake with the intake and what the technique aims to achieve is to squeeze tht air bubble out of the diaphragm in a single breath. on an unrelated note, run outside! if you can get over the mugginess, sg's just a lovely place to be running outside, you'd hardly notice the distance as much with the changing scenery.",3,,GC

What NOT to do as a FOREIGNER in Singapore! 🇸🇬,Stephen Vincent,1 year ago,"Singapore customer service seems to depend on the establishment you’re in. Workers in many stores appear to rely on sales commissions of some sort, so are more attentive (sometimes overly so). Most eating establishments don’t work this way so the service is less attentive. It also very much depends on what you’re used to and your own demeanour and attitude. If you’re civil to people, most will be civil in return. Of course there are always exceptions and we all have bad days.",4,View reply,GC
What NOT to do as a FOREIGNER in Singapore! 🇸🇬,Colin Y,4 months ago,"As for the part about customer service I have to say it all depends on how much you pay...

Let's be honest some of the things here already cheap compared to other developed countries. Those in the lower rung of society are not well-paid here, especially those Hawker Centre assistants. So I kind of understand why they are often so rude and grumpy (not that I like it, it's the main reason I dislike dining there).",0,,GC

On food service, local choose good food and price over service, however do not mistaken minimal service with bad service.

Some of the villagers were farmers, planting vegetables and fruit trees, and there are still pig farms and chicken farms.

But with korean vlogs, they tend to compare alot in such a way that it  sounded as if they look and talk down on the country they are in. And they talk with so much pride as if they are above in status as koreans. It can be seen as offensive. If they have so much pride of their country, why do they need to seek livelihood in other people country? The fact that they do that means, opportunities are not vast or their country doesnt create that environment. Anyway great job for the exploration!",38,,GO

"Hawkers After the Lock Down | Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore",J NotinNYCanymore,3 months ago,I think you have discovered that Singapore really seems like just one big restaurant!  Maybe all of South East Asia like this?  When I was based in NYC I had two assistants that were from Thailand.  We used to poke fun at them for how food-centric they were.  They would start talking about lunch around 10:00am.  Sometimes I would go looking for a stapler or scotch tape and open up a drawer at their desk and it would be like a small 7/11.  Sauces/spices/dried snacks/plastic forks/napkins.  The special treat was when they would sometimes cook lunch for all of us....so GOOD.,21,View reply,GO

To be honest, singlish is not as well respected as the american/british/australian accents for various reasons.There are some singaporeans who try to speak with widely accepted english accents but some still frown upon those people for some reason.

But some of the things you mention sometimes makes me wonder who are those people that shares with you such information? hahahaha and of cos, ive come to realise that the level and opportunities that each Singaporean exposes themselves towards foreign language/ even the standard English does make an impact on how they are able to speak 'better English' and also able to 'listen' and 'understand' foreign language (especially English with their accents e.g. Americans/English) more 'accurately'.",16,,GO

What did Japan do to Singapore? | Civilian War Memorial - Sook Ching,InfernoBeer,9 months ago (edited),"I remember when my grandmother used to tell me about her past experiences living through the Japanese occupation(blood on bayonet rifles, as she would say it)(eating tree roots/barks and water with just a few grains of rice just to survive), mostly about my grandfather who tried to help others as best as he can regardless of how poor of a condition he was in. That he would beg and plea for others who were suspects to be against the occupation and his head would be buried beneath the mud under the soldier's boots, he was mostly lucky she said but his luck ran out when he was drag away one evening never to return again(she teared while struggling to say this part).

( I do agree that It has to be brought to light more in Japanese school ( Kinda like Germany ) Not to shame them but to educate them on the good and bad side of history. so i can honestly say In my viewpoint is that i have forgiven the Japanese of ( WW2 ) What we need now is more friendship and less hatred.

Japanese Reacting to Chinese New Year in Singapore,David Tai Wai Leong,8 months ago,"Hahaha! Thanks Ghib, for sharing this vlog! This really suits the festivities now! 😄😄  About the Yu Sheng, it is indeed from Singapore- a dish invented by 4 Cantonese chefs who wanted to create something that uses simple everyday ingredients in a novel way that celebrates the CNY. Now about the phrases, you’d have to maybe be a Cantonese to enjoy the deeper meanings; besides the auspicious phrases used to describe each ingredient- sometimes with a play of words and as a wish to the business man customers dining at the restaurant (after which the diners will typically tip the waitress) it was served with raw fish slices- the phrase which was 年年有餘 (Having abundance every year) while placing the fish over the ingredients (as 年年有魚)- “Having “Fish” every year”. But the call out was not “Huat” before; it’s “Loh-ah” (捞啊!) which means (getting into business/doing well in business/working hard for business- generally speaking) but it also means “to Mix” in Cantonese; the act of mixing up the ingredients to its final for-consumption stage. The “Huat-ah!” came about because we are culturally diverse and being a majority of Hokkien dialect in Singapore evolves into “Huat-ah!” In Cantonese families, we still use “Loh-ah!” for example. The spillage is not an intended practice as you may be able to imagine how the prim and proper business man in the 60’s would’ve behaved in such a dinner setting. But the consumption of this auspicious dish quickly spread to many many families, in restaurants, in coffee shops and of course the homes. And when this is done in families with little ones or among a group of rowdy friends, squeezed for space to get in on the auspicious action of “Loh-ing” for good luck and prosperity, this do get out of hand- no pun intended. Whilst this practice originated as Cantonese’s, very soon Teochew have their very own style of ingredients used and the type of fish used. But since the ban of raw fish a few years ago, its been down to abalone strips or salmon...which in my opinion, is less tasty now. This practice of course was practiced in Malaysia very quickly because of the huge base of Cantonese there. But surprisingly, the largest base of Cantonese in HK or Guangzhou has only very recently done this.",11,View 4 replies from Ghib Ojisan and others,GO

Possibly The Most Beautiful Town in Singapore | PUNGGOL,pkuma1963,7 months ago,"Your YouTube clips are great! I go through Singapore fairly regularly now, spending three or so nights on my way back to Sydney from Tokyo. I have often seen Punggol as I think a terminating station in the MRT, but never been there. It might indeed be worth an afternoon, just to see the beach, walk or ride through the riverside, and check out the amazing architecture. Singapore is great for an architecture buff like me, as I enjoy taking lots of photos of great architecture and cityscapes, editing them on photoshop for artistic effect etc. Just a hobby. I haven’t gone through all your clips yet, but have you checked out Tiong Bahru? It is possibly my favourite part of Singapore. Streamline Moderne housing estate. Also, have you walked around Alexandra Park where a whole lot of Black and White houses are located. Very leafy,  dry green, very quiet, and beautiful architecture. I wanted to to travel in July this year, to Tokyo and Singapore, but I might have to put that on hold until the Covid-19 is no more. Keep up the great work!",13,,GO

Changi boardwalk is one of our favourite walking area, but we never really took notice of LIB until you video. Keep up the good work & continue being honest with your opinions, be it good or bad.

Maybe I Shouldn't Buy a House in Singapore,Two Claps,2 months ago,"Hello, just want to share my experience and thoughts on your idea of home ownership in Singapore. I always believe your first property should always be a property of purpose, not investment. if it serves your purpose and your parthners, its will be the best buy the two of you will appreciate. If the value of your purposeful property increase, its a bonus. if it doesn't, it has served you well nonetheless. On your mother-in-laws perspective on her HDB and how she can make 2 times the profit. To be honest, her flat would most likely be mostly paid in CPF funds. which means when she sells it, most of the profits will return to CPF as well. And the compounded interest when she used her CPF to buy her HDB will be compounded on a 2.6% per year. If i would make a calculated guess, she bought her flat at 160,000SGD, that would be roughly 20 to 25 years ago? so after the interest that she has to pay back cpf and the profits that has to be returned to cpf base on how many percentage of cpf she used to pay her flat. how much cash can she profit? and even if she does liquidate her flat, where is she going to stay? to buy back the the same flat at the same town she stays, is there still going to be a profit at all? so technically, your mother in laws flat is a purpose property. she has to have a place to stay. So in short, investing in Singapore for a HDB flat is most likely for a purpose, not so much an investment. maybe after your HDB purchase down the road, u can consider getting a place in Japan as an investment property. and then its purely for speculation and for investment. hope this helps you make a decision!",77,View 3 replies,GO

2. also don't compare the price the mother paid for her house in the past with how much a house costs now.

Maybe I Shouldn't Buy a House in Singapore,Alvin Loo,2 months ago,"Ghib-san, if you intent to live in Singapore for at least 5 years, then I will recommend that you buy a flat in Singapore. I hear your worries, that you are afraid that your property may loses value as you live in it. But you have to consider that the government have very tight control over the housing supply in Singapore. Furthermore, a very significant portion of Singaporean's asset are locked in housing. So the government will do its utmost to maintain the pricing of housing to be stable. It might not increase in value by 2 or 3X like before, but as long as there is still at least 40 - 50% of the lease left, it will not decrease in value. If the value of housing decrease in value even before the lease reach the 50% mark, there will be huge public anger and trouble everywhere. The government will simply build less and control the value of flats through controlling the supply. ",58,,GO

I was around during the Tsunami/earthquake thing in 2011. We lost power and water.  I lived in the Tohoku region from 2010 - 2011, 2012 - 2015.   I moved to Tokyo in 2015 and left in 2018.  Tokyo wore me out and wasn't good for my mental health and I was terribly overworked and the higher cost of living didn't help either for the amount of pay I was getting as living in Yamagata-ken, it was easier to pay for my medications, rent, and foods...Tokyo, not so much...but in some ways I do miss Japan since I was over there so long...even Tokyo. I got so used of the earthquakes, it got to the point where I didn't even notice them and the rocking would help me sleep, which is ironic since I come from an area of the US where earthquakes are incredibly rare (east coast). lol",1,View 8 replies,GO

Peak times are during weekdays lunch hour. Crowd usually dies down at around 1.15-1.30pm or you can go early at around 11. Hokkien Street Prawn noodles usually sells out by 2pm.

Nowadays, the birds don’t call as loudly. The small “forest” that used to be around my home were cut down to make way for more blocks of flats. I no longer hear these birds as often, so when I do, it makes me happy, and reminds me of my childhood.",12,,GO

Visiting a Ghost Town in Asia's Richest Country | Woodlands,Flippingthosefins Youdontgettoofar,8 months ago,"@Gjib Ojisan, appreciate it that someone is exploring somewhere outside of the city central, but it seems wrong to call the old woodlands central a ghost town. Although the cinema has been closed for a long time, the area had always been bustling up till 2017, when it was announced that the area would be closed down, and the land used to build an extension of the woodlands check. It was due to this initiative that stalls were closed down, and even the hawker centre was moved to the new marsiling mall. So I would hope that it could be clarified, that the area and this so called “ghost town” was never “abandoned” but was being closed to carry out new plans.",5,View reply,GO

I had first saw there was a post on facebook saying that there was a Japanese Youtuber who had made a video on Yishun. I was curious. After I had watch your video with your thoughts on it. I had found out that I had really enjoy your vlog. From then I was looking forward to your videos on your adventures around Singapore. It had made me feel like I am walking and taking part in your adventure discovering parts of Singapore through your eyes that I had never knew.  You deserve this from the humble videos that you have shown us. To let us see a different side of Singapore that we singaporean have known. Letting  us discovering new destinations around Singapore, from trying out our local food & reccomending the foods to your other viewers from different countries about singapore heartland foods. Another side of singapore that locals & tourists to come and enjoy. Because it's not everyday you will be seeing tourists from other countries try out our coffee shops foods. Most of the time the tourists will be at town or the top famous  destinations in Singapore. And sometimes I myself as a local will be like. Wow. How come I had not discover this place the food. Or like trying out new things that I don't usually do. Thank you once again for coming to our shores of Singapore & more making our lives more interesting. PS: I am from yishun. Hahahaha.

Japanese Attempts to Cook Iconic Singaporean Dish,Pretty Catmint,5 months ago (edited),"Sorry to say but Song Fa adds MSG. They have retail packs and MSG is in the ingredient list. It's really unnecessary with good ingredients and simmered low and slow. Not difficult to make at home. Oou, chicken feet are rich in collagen but you should have snipped off the nails. Well, I made the same mistake when I first made chicken broth at home. To get rid of the gamey smell and impurities, place meat in room temperature water, bring a boil for 5 minute. Remove and rinse well in running water. Place meat in fresh water with spice pouches and bring to a boil and then simmer for one hour or longer. Good job on your maiden attempt.",24,View 2 replies,GO

My Social Studies teacher actually talked about Singapore's state right now. Due to the Covid-19, there are fewer foreigners coming to Singapore. This led to many discounts on for locals for several attractions (hence the 50% discount and if I'm not wrong, there are discounts for USS as well). This is to attract the locals to spend, keeping SG's economy from falling. Basically if there aren't foreigners to spend money in SG, SGeans have to spend theirs (to support the economy). ",24,,GO

Say Hi To This Kind Man! PAYA LEBAR Expedition in Singapore,Eduardo King,6 months ago,"Another great video. Yes..you are right, and smarter than a lot of foreigners...just because I think, you took the time to travel to less know areas..
Singapore is not that expensive a country as many foreigners think. It all depends on where in Singapore you are. Food is cheap at the hawker centres and other stuff like clothing too in the outlying areas. I visited Singapore in 2018 expecting prices to be way higher in Canada, but really they are about the same, with hawker centre food being way cheaper than in Canada. I don't think Singapore deserves to be in the World's most expensive city spot. It is quite affordable. Public transport is also very cheap. In Canada, it is 2-3 times higher. Hotel accommodation is also slightly cheaper and much better too for the price you pay. Singaporeans have much to be grateful for but I hear from my friend there that many complain a lot and think the grass is greener overseas. It really is not.",19,,GO

(idk abt how will they do it for the P5s this year, i feel bad for them) also, its not normal that every household could get 1 funpack each as you only could get it if u were to attend the rehearsal/actual show. regarding about the coupon thing that ur 'mum' mentioned, it can be found online on a website cuz its an e-booklet this year.",29,,GO

Japanese Searching for Flaws at Singapore's TOP Polytechnic | Ngee Ann Poly,Ahlora Chew,8 months ago (edited),"In Singapore, after you graduate Secondary school, and get either N Level or O Level certificate, majority of the students get to choose whether you want to take a diploma or an A Level certificate. If you want to specify in a specific field, then a diploma in that field is what they take, and the polytechnics provide this. Polytechnics and ITEs (which is another choice you can go to) focus more on vocational and work skills. That is why the school campus is so big, because in Ngee Ann alone, it is split into (if I'm not wrong), 9 schools. Each school teaching different fields. Eg, Technology, Film, Art, Engineering, Business, Sciences. There are internal shuttle buses to move within the school easier.

My Culture Shock in Japan | USA & Singapore vs Japan,Philip Soon,5 months ago,"Being a Canadian that’s born in S’pore, I’ve visited Tokyo briefly on my trips back to S’pore. The 2 things that strikes me most is the meticulous cleanliness of everything - even backstreets and alleys, and the politeness of the sales staff. These two observations have to be personally experienced to be fully appreciated. I’m an avid photographer and would search out off the ordinary local scenes wherever I go, taking me through nooks and corners. Believe me, a photographer’s eyes tend to pickup little details often overlooked by others, and I was just amazed at the cleanliness in Tokyo👍",2,,GO

When speaking of nouns in repetition, the second character would be emphasized.

When nouns that have 2 exact words, the pinyin is different for both characters. For example,  哥, as is would be prononuced as gē. However, when you use 哥哥 the pin yin would be gē ge.

Because of the way our education works,  many parents emphasize a lot into academic  but not on moral educations. That is why there is this ""high self-entitlement"" status in Singapore, like what you have talk about the ""selfishness"". Additional to that, SG population is well-mixed with foreigners so it is pretty hard to point fingers at who are the problematic ones.

My Honest Thoughts on Living in Singapore for 1 Year,Taufiq AR,7 months ago,"Hey Ghib love your videos! Here are some things i would say about japan too: during rush hours in tokyo its almost impossible to board a train. You will be pushed and even stepped on. The person won't even look at you and say sorry. Because it became like a norm. But i feel thats double standard - for a country thats supposed to be so polite, why would you do that and not even say 'excuse me' or sorry. Secondly lets not forget about ""Chikans"".. Japan is probably the only country where molestation rate is so high that separate 'women only' train carts had to be introduced.. and to make the matters worse, most of the victims just secretly gets molested without raising any voice. Such case in singapore is very rare. Thirdly, when an elderly comes in the train or bus, most people give up their seats in Singapore. It never happens in Japan unless its a special seat. You talked about Japan being clean - i used to think that too but If you go to the back  ally of Shibiya, Shinjuku, Ebisu you will see how crazy it is. Unlike singapore japan doesn't have any trash bins and they expect everyone to carry their own trash. Well many people (especially young ones) doesn't want to do that, so they trash the street and sidewalks. In singapore you don't see it often. And i dont think people are afraid to get a fine, its just that the trash bins are everywhere. You talked about the weather - Japan isnt always cold ..you have summer and also other pleasant seasons when the temperature is just nice. So there is a variety. In singapore its always summer every day of the year ..if you live here for 10 years you may start to miss winter again.  You are right about Conbini and super having good professional service, but then again most frontline staff in Singapore are not really Singaporeans due to pay being low and cost of living being high. In Japan even though there are some foreigners in frontline recently, majority i believe are still Japanese. I feel most Japanese people  don't know how to express themselves well, or say no or have a voice of their own. So they cant really speak their mind which is why they are sometimes following rules blindly. I feel its not very good and needs to change. Frankly you have been very nice about Singaporeans in your video. i think the culture here is unique just like how it is in Japan.",63,,GO

There are a lot of inconsiderate Singaporeans, but people should also keep in mind that almost half the population in Singapore are not natives, so you cannot guarantee that the bad behavior you happen to encounter is from a local. I have seen my fair share of bad behavior, from Singaporeans and foreigners alike. But all in all you are right on the money, as long as you think of it as the behavior of the people in Singapore, and not the behavior of Singaporeans.

My Honest Thoughts on Living in Singapore for 1 Year,hangkook,7 months ago,"There are 2 things I've to wholeheartedly agree with you as a Singaporean. The social etiquette (manners) and lack of an appreciation of hygiene and consideration for others. Some people esp elderly aunties can't wait for passengers to get out before they get in (I feel like slapping them!) at MRT. Then those that don;t even say thank you to you for holding the lift door open for them, instead they take their own sweet time to walk to the lift. So fed up with their sense of entitlement, I stop being kind to such idiots. It is also the very reason why some shop assistants don't greet people anymore esp Singaporeans because some among us don't respond ( I'm sure a smile will suffice even if you don't feel like greeting back!). Also while this conoravirus has made some Singaporeans mask themselves when they are sick, I'm sure once this is over, they will continue to cough into the air and spread their flu to innocent persons. I think some selfish Singaporeans need something really deadly to teach them a hard lesson about civic consciousness for others and personal hygiene. Like Minister Chan Chun Seng says of some Singaporeans in the leaked closed door discussion with business owners, these idiots that panic grabbed every damn thing on the shelves are ""sia suay"" (disgraceful).",18,View reply from Ghib Ojisan,GO

They are people from the earlier generation, so the way they speak is like this... but they are generally nice people and their shop really sells things in a very very affordable price. The biscuits are nice too! go back and buy 100g per type at least. Honestly, I was super shocked when you took 1 pc of each... LOL",18,,GO

They are so nice to let you get one of each :)",36,,GO
